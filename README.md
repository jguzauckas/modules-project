This project is meant to offer you some challenges that can incorporate our modules from last class as well as a lot of the skills from previously in our class.

The project.py file has instructions for what you should program and the project-completed.py file has a completed assignment following the same instructions. Please use the instructions sparingly and do your best to work through the problems without referencing them/minimally referencing them.

Good luck!
