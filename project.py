# Import our three modules.


# Make a blank list called grades.  Use the random module to
# add 1,000 random scores (1 to 100) to the list for us to
# work with.


# Use the math module to find a quick average of all of the
# grades and print the result out nicely.  (Because this was
# random, we expect it to be close to 50)


# Print out the highest grade and the number of people who
# achieved it.  Repeat with the lowest grade


# Make a blank list called dates.  Use the datetime and random
# modules to add 1000 random dates to the list.  The random
# dates should all have the year 2022, with a randomized month,
# and day (from 1 to 28)


# Count the number of times your birthday from this year occurs
# in the list and report the result.


# Determine the percentage of the dates that occurred before
# right now (in time) and report the result.


# Create a Student class that contains the following properties:
#   - gender - string, male, female, etc. (you pick
#       number of options)
#   - group - string: A, B, C, D, or E
#   - completed test prep course - bool
#   - math score - int 0 - 100
#   - reading score - int 0 - 100
#   - writing score - int 0 - 100
# You should have getter and setter methods for all of the above
# properties.  Make sure to guarantee the values are acceptable
# (i.e. scores between 0 and 100, group between A and E)
# You should also have __init__ and __str__ methods

# Create a blank list called students.  Generate 100 random students
# by doing the following each time:
#   - Use a random number to assign a gender (i.e. 1 is female,
#       2 is male, etc.)
#   - Use a random number to assign a group (i.e. 1 is A, 2 is B,
#       etc.)
#   - Use a random number to assign a test prep (i.e. 1 is True,
#       2 is False)
#   - Assign random scores for math, reading, and writing


# Please note for the following sections, we expect no appreciable
# difference between groups because the data is completely random.
# Determine which group of students performed the best in math
# by calculating average scores based on the groups students were in
# and comparing them.  To do this, you will want to:
#   - Create a function that averages all the scores given a particular
#       group as an input.
#   - Create a dictionary where you store the average grades for each
#       of the groups.
#   - Print out the dictionary.


# Do the same as the above for the gender of students on reading.


# Finally do the same as the above for students that have completed
# a test preparation course vs. students that have not on writing.
